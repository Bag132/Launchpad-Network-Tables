# Launchpad-mini-Network-Tables
## Puts input from a launchpad onto NetworkTables
## Needs pygame and pynetworktables

Sort of finished idk it works I guess and if you found this somehow and you're from another team just change the ip variable so it works for your team and remap the buttons if you want.
The IP should be in the format 10.TE.AM.2

run main.py btw

uses Python 3.7.4
